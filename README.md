Coin Collector Game
-------------------

This is a coin collector game I wrote for my final Games Development module at college.

The game is a written in [Lua](http://www.lua.org) and uses the [LÃ–VE 2d Game Engine](https://love2d.org).

There's plenty of room for improvement, but I still got a Distinction, so who's complaining?!
